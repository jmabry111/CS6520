## Switching

### Switching and Bridging

* ARP allows query for an IP Address to map that address to a MAC Address
* Hosts build ARP tables to save MAC-IP Mapping
* Encapsulation:
  * source puts IP packet in ethernet frame with it's MAC address and the Destination MAC Address from ARP Table

### Hubs
* Broadcast medium - All packets go out all ports regardless of which MAC address they are destined for
* COLLISIONS and LATENCY occur

### Switches: Traffic Isolation
* Learn MAC addresses so that the packet only goes out ports where the destination is connected
* If destination MAC address is not known it floods packet out all ports until it gets a response, then will remember the port the response came in on
* Loops - most network contain for redundancy
  * Broadast packet is flooded out all ports
  * If there is a loop, the looped port is confused and doesnt know whether to remember the broadcast or flood out all ports again.

### Spanning Tree
**Allow loop free forwarding on a topology that may contain cycles.**

### Constructing Spanning Tree
1.  Select root (e.g. switch with smallest ID)
2.  **At each switch:** exclude link if not on shortest path to root

* Initially, every node thinks its the root.
  * update view of root
  * compute new root

## Switches vs. Routers
* Switches: Layer 2/Ethernet
  * Auto-configuring
  * Forwarding tends to be fast
  * **Major limitations**
    * Broadcast - spanning tree, ARP queries, have high overhead
* Routers: Layer 3/IP
  * Not restricted to spanning tree

### Buffer Sizing
* How much buffering do routers/switches need?
  * Base Rule: Buffer = 2time X capacity

### Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
* More variables => narrorwer Gaussian
* congestion windows of flows => fluctuation of sum of all congestion windows
* 2tXc -> (2tXc)/âˆšn
