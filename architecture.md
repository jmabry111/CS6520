##ARPANET
* 1966 - 1967
* Goal was to network academic computers
* in 1970 there were ~20 nodes
* 1974 many more nodes
* SATNet, Packet radio, Ethernet LANs also in existance

### TCP/IP Started around 1973

* **1982 - DNS**
* **1988 - TCP Congestion control** 
* **1989 - BGP**
* **1992 - Streaming media**
* **1993 - WWW**
* **1995 - Altavista**
* **2000 - P2P, filesharing**

##Problems now
1. Running out of IPv4 addresses
  * not allocated well
2. Congestion control
  * insufficient dynamic range
  * standards must be widely adopted and used
3. Routing
  * no security
  * easily misconfigured
  * poor convergence
  * non-determinism
4. Security
  * bad at key management
  * secure software deployment
5. DOS
  * too easy to send traffic to destination
6. **All require changes to basic infrastrucure**
