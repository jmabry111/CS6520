# Router Design

### Increased demand for big, fast routers
* Links are getting faster
* Demands are increasing (streaming video, etc)
* Networks are growing larger

## Basic Router Architecture
1.  Receive packet
2.  Look at header to determine destination
3.  Look in forwarding table to determine output interface
4.  Modify header (TTL, checksums)
5.  Send packet to output interface

* Line card is the I/O interface
  * Main line card is usually an aggregate of smaller line cards

### Important decision: Each line card has own fwding table copy
* Prevents a central table from becoming a bottleneck
* Older routers did not copy table and shared bus becomes bottleneck

### Crossbar Switching
* Shared Bus can only be used by 1 line card at a time - bad
* Every input port has a connection to every output port
* During each timeslot each input connected to zero or 1 outputs
  * Advantage: Parallelism
  * But: need scheduling algorithms
* Crosbar Switching Algorithm
  * Maximal Matching
  * Conceptually, N inputs, N outputs
  * In each timeslot, 1-1 mapping between inputs and outputs
  * INterconnects usually run faster than line card speed

* Head of Line Blocking
  * some packets can get stuck in queue behind slower traffic
  * Solution: Virtual Output Queues
  * allows matching based on speed

* Scheduling and Fairness
  * During which timeslots should inputs and output parts be matched
  * Need Efficiency, and Fairness

* Max-Min Fairness
  * *Maximizes the minimum share to each user whose demand is not fully serviced*
  * flow allocation: {x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>}
  * "max-min fair"
  * increasing any x<sub>i</sub> => some other x<sub>j</sub> < x<sub>i</sub> must be decreased
  * small demands get what they want
  * large users split the rest of the capacity
  * [Max-Min Fairness Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5uHTkM17P8)
* Achieving Max-Min Fairness
  1. Round-Robin Scheduling
    * Problem: packets may have different sizes so take different times
  2. Bit-by-bit scheduling
    * Problem: Feasibility
  3. Fair Queueing -> service packets according to soonest finishing time
    * computes virtual finishing times for each packet
    * services minimum virtual finishing time first
