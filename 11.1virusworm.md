# Viruses and Worms

## Virus:
* "Infection" of an existing program that results in modification of behavior
* Require user activity

### Types of Viruses
* *Parasitic* - infects executable files
* *Memory-resident* - infect running programs
* *Boot-sector* - spreads when system is booted
* *Polymorphic* - encrypt part of virus program using randomly generated keys

## Worm:
* Code that propagates/replicates across the network
* Propagate automatically
* Can use any techniques listed above in types of viruses

### Internet Worm Life Cycle
1. Discover/scan network for vulnerable hosts
2. Infect vulnerable machines via remote exploit

### "Morris" Worm
* Designed by Robert Morris, 1988
* No malicious payload
  *  but resource exhaustion (bogged machine down)
* Multiple vectors
  * remote shell execution/weak passwords
  * buffer overflow/remote exploit
  * Debug in sendmail

### General Approach to design
1. Scan to find vulnerable hosts
2. Spread
3. Remain undiscoverable

### Worm Outbreaks
* Summer 2001
  * Code Red I
    * July 13, 2001
    * "modern" worm
    * IIS buffer overflow
    * 1st - 20th of the month it spread
    * "random" scanning
    * v2 infected 350K hosts in 14 hours
    * Payload: DoS on whitehouse.gov
  * Code Red II
    * Exploited same vulnerability
    * August 4, 2001
    * Only ran on Windows 2000
    * Scan preferred nearby addresses
    * Payload: IIS backdoor
  * Nimda
    * September 18, 2001
    * Exploited the same IIS vulnerablility
    * Spread via multiple methods
    * "multi-modal"
    * bulk emails
    * vulnerable web site exploits
    * copied itself to open network shares
    * scanned for Code Red II backdoors
    * 1st "Zero-Day" attack

### Random Constant Spread model
* K: initial compromise rate
* N: # of vulnerable hosts
* a: fraction of host already compromised
* Nda = (Na)xK(1-a)df

### Increasing Initial Compromise Rate
1. Hit List: List of vulnerable hosts
  * increase 0-day infections
2. Permutation scanning: Shared permutation of IP address lists
  * Start from own IP and work down
* Slammer Worm - January 24-25, 2003
  * Used above techniques
  * Entire code was contained in **one** UDP packet
  * Caused 1.2 billion in damage
  * BOA Atms, Cell phones, 5 root DNS servers
  * No payload but caused severe resource exhaustion
  * Spread worldwide in 30 minutes
