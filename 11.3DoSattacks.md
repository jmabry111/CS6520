# Denial of Service Attacks

## What is DoS?
* Attempt to exhaust resources:
  * Network bandwidth
  * TCP connections
  * Server resources (web services)
* Pre-2000 - single source DoS attacks
* Post-2000 - Distributed DoS (DDoS)

### Defenses
1. Ingress filtering
  * Stub network - 204.69.207.0/24
  * Drop of src = this subnet
  * works at edges
2. uRPF checks
  * Use routing tables to determine if packets should arrive on an interface
  * Drop packet if packet comes on wrong interface
  * requires symmetric routing
3. Syn Cookies (TCP)
  * When Syn is sent, no buffer is allocated
  * receiver generates a sequence number based on srcIP,src port,dstIP,dst port, and a random other value (to prevent replay attacks)
  * honest client can reply with sequence number and receiver re-computes the hash to be sure it matches

### Inferring DoS Activity (Backscatter)
* IP address spoofing -> "backscatter"
  * replies to forged attack messages
* monitor n IP addresses
* have m backscatter packets
* expect (n/2<sub>32</sub>)m
* total attack rate m = x(2<sub>32</sub>/n)
